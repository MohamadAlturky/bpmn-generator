Please generate all possible activity sequences for the process described below:

**Process Description**: {process_description}

**Instructions**:
1. **Input**: Use the provided process description to identify all activities involved.
2. **Output**: List all possible sequences of activities flows that can occur in the process.
3. **Format**: The sequences should be displayed in the following format:
   ```
   Activity1 -> Activity2 -> Activity3
   Activity1 -> Activity4 -> Activity5
   ...
   ```
4. **Considerations**: 
   - Ensure that all potential branching paths, loops, and parallel activities are considered and represented.
   - Do not skip any steps; every possible sequence must be shown.

**Example**:
For the following process:
```
Process Description: 
1. Start with Activity A.
2. After Activity A, either proceed to Activity B or Activity C.
3. Activity B leads to Activity D, while Activity C leads to Activity E.
4. Both Activity D and Activity E lead to the final Activity F.
```
The expected output should be:
```
Activity A -> Activity B -> Activity D -> Activity F
Activity A -> Activity C -> Activity E -> Activity F
```
