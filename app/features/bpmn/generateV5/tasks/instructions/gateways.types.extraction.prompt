Given the following information:

- **Process Description**: {process_description}
- **BPMN Diagram**: {BPMN_flows}
- **Gateways**: {gateways}

Generate a JSON object that includes:
1. `"gatewayTypeMapping"`: A mapping of each gateway to its corresponding type.
2. `"gatewayConditions"`: A mapping of each outgoing connection from a gateway to the subsequent activity, along with the associated condition for that path, you can get the condition from the process description.

**Allowed Gateway Types**:
- "and gateway", "xor gateway", "or gateway"

**Expected JSON Format**:
```json
{
  "gatewayTypeMapping": {
    "Gateway1": "xor gateway",
    "Gateway2": "and gateway"
  },
  "gatewayConditions": {
    "Gateway1": {
      "Activity3": "Condition1",
      "Activity4": "Condition2"
    },
    "Gateway2": {
      "Activity5": "Condition3",
      "Activity6": "Condition4"
    }
  }
}
```

Ensure the JSON object adheres to this structure.
