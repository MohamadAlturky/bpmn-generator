In Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), **pools** and **lanes** are used to organize and structure a process diagram, helping to clarify responsibilities and interactions between different participants or departments.
- **Pools** are used to distinguish between different participants or entities in a process, often representing organizations or departments.
- **Lanes** within a pool are used to further detail roles, departments, or functions within the same organization or participant, clarifying who performs which tasks in the process.
