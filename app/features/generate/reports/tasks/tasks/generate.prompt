In Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), a task is a self-contained activity that represents a piece of work to be performed within a process. Here are some common types of tasks in BPMN:

**Types of Tasks:**

1. **Service Task**: A service task represents an action or operation that can be invoked as a service, such as a database query, a web service call, or an external system interaction.
2. **User Task**: A user task represents a step where a human participant is required to perform some work, such as filling out a form or making a decision.
3. **Script Task**: A script task allows you to execute a small piece of code or a script within the process. This can be useful for automating specific tasks or performing complex calculations.
4. **Manual Task**: A manual task represents a step where no automation is possible, and human intervention is required.
